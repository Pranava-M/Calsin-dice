# Python Projects: Scientific Calculator and Dice Roller

This repository contains two distinct Python projects:
1. A **3D Scientific Calculator** with GUI
2. A simple **Dice Rolling Simulator** (CLI)

## 1. 3D Scientific Calculator

![Calculator Demo](calculator_screenshot.png) *Screenshot placeholder*

A feature-rich scientific calculator with modern styling and advanced functionality.

### Features:
- Basic operations (+, -, ×, ÷, ^)
- Scientific functions:
  - Trigonometric (sin, cos, tan) and inverse
  - Logarithms (log, ln)
  - Square root and power functions
  - Factorials and constants (π, e)
  - Unit conversion (degrees/radians)
- History tracking
- 3D-style interface with green LCD-like display
- Error handling and input validation
- Keyboard support

# Requires Python and Tkinter
sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Linux systems


### 
This README:
- Provides a clear separation between both projects
- Includes installation and usage instructions
- Lists key features for each
- Shows code formatting with proper markdown
- Maintains a professional structure while being readable
- Works as a single documentation file for both programs

To use this README:
1. Create a new file named `README.md`
2. Paste this content
3. Replace placeholder information (author name, screenshot path) with your actual details
4. Save in the same directory as your Python files

I suggest adding screenshots for the calculator interface to make it more visually appealing.

### Installation:
```bash
# Requires Python and Tkinter
sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Linux systems
